# Hello, I'm James!

I'm a current law enforcement analyst turned AI and data professional. With over a decade of experience in problem solving on the fly, pattern recognition, and high-pressure decision-making, I’ve transitioned into the world of Artificial Intelligence, data science, and automation with a strong foundation in Python, Excel, and machine learning. I've helped to develop a real-time crime center using automation, SQL, and connecting databases for an easier search method to help solve crimes from the simplest theft to violent homicides.

I'm fascinated by how AI can be used to augment human insight, especially in fields like public safety, ethics, and even spaceflight (yes, I'm interested in companion AI for Mars missions).
